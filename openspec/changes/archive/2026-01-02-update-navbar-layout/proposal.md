# Change: Update Navbar Layout and Title

## Why
The current navbar has the title "小说分析器" on the left and settings/theme buttons on the right. User wants the header and controls centered to align with the main content area, and rename the title to "涩涩小说分析器".

## What Changes
- Center the navbar content (title + settings icon + theme toggle) to align with `max-w-4xl` main content
- Rename "小说分析器" to "涩涩小说分析器" in both the page title and navbar

## Impact
- Affected files: `templates/index.html`
- No breaking changes
- Pure UI/cosmetic change
